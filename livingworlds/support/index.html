			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Why are the images portrait when Joseph's demo is landscape?</h3>
			<p>Note that <a href="http://www.effectgames.com/demos/worlds/">Joseph's demo</a> actually uses modified versions of the original art; Wizards of the Coast commissioned updates and expansions to a few of the images for their game battle mage, and those are the images Joseph used. There isn't a complete set of 12 months in that size, however, nor are any of the overlays made for that size. Because of that, and to as faithfully as possible re-create the original Seize the Day worlds, we're using the original graphics.</p>
